# Pomodoro Clock
A Javascript implementation of a Pomodoro Clock based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

The clock has default values of 25 minutes for a session and 5 minutes for a break. These can be customised to up to 120 minutes for each.

From The Odin Project's curriculum (topic now removed)

Creating this project allowed me to practice using many of the Javascript fundamentals as well as DOM manipulation and the use of Event Listeners.
